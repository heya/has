# Has [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/heya/has.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/heya/has) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/heya/has.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Pure feature detection library, a la carte style. It is based on dojo.has,
which is based on [has.js](https://github.com/phiggins42/has.js/) started
by Peter Higgins.

## How to install

If you plan to use it in your [node.js](http://nodejs.org) project install it
like this:

```
npm install heya-has
```

For your browser-based projects I suggest to use [volo.js](http://volojs.org):

```
volo install heya/has heya-has
```
